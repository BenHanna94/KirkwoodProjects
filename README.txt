This repository is a collection of all of the projects I worked on at Kirkwood.

The Art App is something I created entirely on my own, while the Pet Universe program and the design report for the System Design Project PDF were something I participated with as a group, both times in the Animal related group.

Thanks for checking out my work. I hope you find it interesting!
