This repository is a collection of all of the projects I worked on at Kirkwood.

The Art App is something I created entirely on my own, while the Pet Universe program and the design report for the System Design Project PDF were something I participated with as a group, both times in the Animal related group.

The Client Side Scripting project was supposed to be a job application form that mimics the style from a real company. In my infinite creativity, I chose Kirkwood. Clearly it doesn't actually submit it to anything, but everything else works in the form.

Thanks for checking out my work. I hope you find it interesting!

INSTRUCTIONS

For two of these apps, you'll need to run the database scripts first. 

The Pet Universe scripts are in Capstone-2020\PetUniverse\DB_bat_Scripts. Try create_db_script_home.bat first, but if that doesnt work, run create_db_script_school.bat

The art app database script is in ArtAppWeb\ArtDB. Look for create_db.bat


Art App
The web client uses a self populating ASP Identity database. 
To log into the web client, first register a new user using the username and password from the offline DB
I reccomend joanne@company.com with the password newuser (she should work for the local app as well!)
She has every single role enabled on her, so you can explore the web front end as much as you want.

Pet Universe (Capstone 2020)
Once you have a DB, all you need to do is log in as zbehrens@PetUniverse.com with the password newuser
It should prompt you to change your password from the default. Once you do, you're golden.

Client Side Scripting (Javascript & html)
This has no account system or real functionality. It's just meant as a mockup to display JS skills. Poke through it as much as you want.
