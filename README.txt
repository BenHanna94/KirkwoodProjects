This repository is a collection of all of the projects I worked on at Kirkwood.

The Art App is something I created entirely on my own, while the Pet Universe program and the design report for the System Design Project PDF were something I participated with as a group, both times in the Animal related group.

Thanks for checking out my work. I hope you find it interesting!

INSTRUCTIONS
Art App
The web client uses a self populating ASP Identity database. 
To log into the web client, first register a new user using the username and password from the offline DB
I reccomend joanne@company.com with the password newuser (she should work for the local app as well!)
She has every single role enabled on her, so you can explore the web front end as much as you want.
